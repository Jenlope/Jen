The program objectives are to encrypt and decrypt the message using a polyalphabetic cipher. Our program interacts with the user by asking them if they want to encrypt and decrypt whatever message. The user then inputs the message to be encrypted and decrypted; it is put through a key and matched. Lastly, the encrypted or decrypted message is displayed for the user to complete its purpose.
